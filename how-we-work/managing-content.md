## Landing page cards

The cards at the bottom of [the landing page](https://www.p2pu.org/en/) can be managed using the [NetlifyCMS interface](https://www-staging.p2pu.org/en/admin/#/collections/data/entries/landing%20page). The "cards" and "testimonials" lists are combined and sorted according to the order attribute in reverse order, so that when adding a new item to either list, the order must be manually set to a number higher than the highest number in either list to appear first.

Images can either be uploaded using the image widget, or set to an image URL hosted somewhere else like the P2PU Wordpress blog. When adding images, ensure that the image file size is appropriate (preferable much smaller than 200kb, but definitely not any larger!) since the landing page is the most viewed page.&#x20;
