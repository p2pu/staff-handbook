# ðŸ‘‹ Onboarding & Offboarding

**Joining P2PU**

The goal of the onboarding process is to both welcome the new hire into the organization and help them take ownership in their role. P2PU maintains a Github Project which includes various elements of the onboarding process. The first 90 days of employment will be an introductory period for new team members and P2PU to get acquainted with one another. New hires should not take on a leadership role in governance until at least 90 days have elapsed since the the hire date.

**Leaving P2PU**

Upon departure, team members will generally lose their P2PU email address, but are invited to stay part of the virtual community. Before departure, all documents and accounts should be transferred to the admin account. 

Contractors will be discharged when their assignment is completed. If a contractor leaves before their agreed upon task has been completed, this may result in P2PU not paying the full amount to the contractor.
