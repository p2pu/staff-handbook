### &#x20;**Learning circle creation**

* Notification process
  * When a learning circle is created through [the creation form](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/create/), the user receives an email notification from ‚Äò[learningcircles@p2pu.org](mailto:learningcircles@p2pu.org)‚Äô which indicates that the draft sign up page is ready or that the signup page is live. This email also includes the responses to the questions ‚ÄòWhat do you hope to achieve by facilitating this learning circle?‚Äô and ‚ÄòIs there anything that we can help you with as you get started?‚Äô.
  * These recipients of these notifications differ depending on the circumstances:
    * If a draft learning circle is created, only [thepeople@p2pu.org](mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org) receives the notification.
    * If the user is associated with a team, but does not indicate a response to ‚ÄòIs there anything that we can help you with as you get started?‚Äô, then [thepeople@p2pu.org](mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org) and the team‚Äôs organizer email receives the notification
    * If the user is associated with a team, and does indicate a response to ‚ÄòIs there anything that we can help you with as you get started?‚Äô, then [thepeople@p2pu.org](mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org), the team‚Äôs organizer email, and [welcome@p2pu.org](mailto:welcome@p2pu.org) receives the notification. NB [welcome@p2pu.org](mailto:welcome@p2pu.org) represent the emails of a few select experienced learning circle facilitators, nicknamed ‚Äòthe welcome committee‚Äô.
