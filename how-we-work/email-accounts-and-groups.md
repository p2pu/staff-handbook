# ðŸ“¨ Email Accounts & Groups

### **Accounts**

Aside from team email accounts, there are a few additional accounts in the @p2pu.org domain. An account should be created when you want to retain a full archive of emails independently of team membersâ€™s accounts.&#x20;

* **admin@p2pu.org** is the owner of important documents and is used to sign up for services.
  * **admin-cc@p2pu.org** (Dirk, Grif, Ryan, Becky) receives all mail sent to admin@p2pu.org
