# How We Work

We use 9-5 local time as a general reference for working hours, but there is a great deal of flexibility, as we are more concerned with getting the job done and making sure weâ€™re staying connected to our colleagues and partners.

### WIP (Monday at 9 ET, wrangled by Grif)

Where we develop, check in on, and reflect on individual progress against organizational goals.

### Tech (Tuesday at 9 ET, wrangled by Dirk)

Where we review pull requests, address new bugs and issues, and work new features through product development cycle.

### Comms (Wednesday at 10:30 ET, wrangled by Becky)

Where we check-in on community activity & relationships, plan upcoming events, and address comms-facing items on the roadmap.

### Team Call (Thursday at 9ET, wrangled by Grif)

Where we conduct shared governance and dig in to issues that can use some extra team time, including fundraising, comms check in, professional development, project management, upcoming events, reviewing the roadmap, etc.

### Facilitation Journal (Following all public calls, wrangled by facilitator)

Where we run a short (\~5 min) facilitation reflection after public calls.
