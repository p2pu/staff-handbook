# How We Work

We use 9-5 local time as a general reference for working hours, but there is a great deal of flexibility, as we are more concerned with getting the job done and making sure weâ€™re staying connected to our colleagues and partners.

### WIP (Monday 3-4PM UTC)

Where we develop, check in on, and reflect on individual progress against organizational goals.

### Tech (currently not scheduled)

Where we review pull requests, address new bugs and issues, and work new features through product development cycle.

### Team Time (Thursday 3-6PM UTC)

Where we conduct shared governance and dig in to issues that can use some extra team time, including fundraising, comms, professional development, project management, upcoming events, reviewing the roadmap, etc.

### Facilitation Journal (Following all public calls, wrangled by facilitator)

Where we run a short (\~5 min) facilitation reflection after public calls.
