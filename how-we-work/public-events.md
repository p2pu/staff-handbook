# ðŸŽŸ Public Events

### **Types of Public Events**

  * When: First Wednesday of the month at 12pm ET
  * Who: People with active learning circles.
* **P2PU Community Calls:** This is for people who are interested in a specific area and topic but may not be actively running learning circles. ****&#x20;
  * When: Quarterly&#x20;
  * Who: Entire community (newsletter + accounts)
* **Working Groups:** Working groups that meet weekly for a set period of time should either meet an immediate need (e.g. pandemic response), be done for as part of a funded project (e.g. KC APP), or serve a wider goal for P2PU (e.g. planning a gathering)
* **Ad Hoc Calls:** Reach out to community collaborators at least four weeks beforehand. Complete the agenda 2-3 weeks beforehand. Meet 5-10 minutes before the call begins to test tech ****&#x20;
