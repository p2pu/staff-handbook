# ☎️  Team Communications

### Email

* When you copy team on an email, state the expectation for response
* Always ask a specific person or specific persons \[FYI vs. @person]
* When the expectation changes (ex. it was FYI, but now I need input), make that clear
* When something is urgent, say so in the subject line and include the deadline
* Think twice before adding or removing people to email threads

### Slack

* Limit private messages to banter
* Keep channels aligned with meetings & projects
* [#](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23updates-comms)[updates-](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23updates-comms)[comms](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23updates-comms) is an automatic feed of news alerts, forum posts, and social media mentions
* [#](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23updates-github)[updates-](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23updates-github)[github](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23updates-github) is an automatic feed of issues, pulls, and pushes from primary Github repos

### GitHub

* Use issues for discrete, comprehensive documentation of bugs, mistakes, or individual small features. The amount of time it will take to address the issue should be immediately clear.
  * [Learning-Circles issues](https://github.com/p2pu/learning-circles/issues) for anything related to the Django app (i.e. learning circles)
  * [P2PU-website issues](https://github.com/p2pu/p2pu-website/issues) for Github pages sites (e.g. landing page, about, facilitate, etc.)
  * [CIAB issues](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box/issues) for the course in a box template
  * [Learning about Learning Circles issues](https://github.com/p2pu/learning-about-learning-circles) for online course
* Use projects to aggregate issues across different deliverables.
  * Add urgent items to [General Prioritized](https://github.com/orgs/p2pu/projects/4)
* Use labels on issues to denote urgency and scope of issue

### Discourse

We use [community.p2pu.org](https://community.p2pu.org/) as our public community space. Often times, what we want to discuss as a team can be discussed there. If a forum post exists on the topic, opt towards having conversations there, i.e.

*
  * Discussing topics for upcoming community calls
  * Giving feedback on mockups
  * Sharing feedback about courses

### Google Drive

We use Google Drive as a storage and collaboration tool for most of our shared work. The primary folders are:

* **Communications** > Conferences, workshops, swag, p2pu gatherings, media mentions, etc.
* **Community** > Calls, working group agendas, and moderation practices.
* **Courses** > Everything related to learning resources: courses we create, topic guides, facilitator guides, etc.
* **Current Project** > Funded projects that we're working on. Some of these are just folders for contracts and admin info, others are more like workspaces.
* **Finance & Ops** > Budgets, cost allocation, salary model, bank details, etc.
* **Governance & Strategy** > Board meetings, WIP, P2PU Governance notes, and strategy documentation
* **HR & PD** > Job descriptions, contracts, travel/time off, and professional development meetings
* **Lead Generation** > Past proposals, unfunded work, and active proposals
* **Membership** > Documentation related to managing ongoing member relationships with teams
* **Roadmap** > Feature development roadmap
* **Staff Folders** > Personal folders for each team member
* **Tech** > Software feature docs, Course-in-a-Box, website, and sysadmin stuff

A few best practices that we’ve identified when working with Google Drive

* Make sure that all files are stored the appropriate folder with appropriate permissions
  * Default to private documents with edit access across @p2pu
  * For public-facing resources, add whichever public permission (read, suggest, edit) based on what makes sense for the resource.
* When resolving somebody else’s comment, always a leave a comment to notify them, even if it’s just to say “cleaning up comments to prepare doc to share” or “incorporated feedback”, etc.
