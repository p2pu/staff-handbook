  Shared expectations of team members, to be signed upon joining P2PU as a team
  member and refined over time by the team. Not to supersede individual work
  contracts.

# Team Charter

By joining P2PU as a team member, you agree to the following:

* **Leave P2PU better than you found it:** Commit to the governance model in good faith and be vocal about improving it over time.
* **Involve the team:** Independently advance projects you’re working on, but involve the group in your decisions and set up discussions to maximize input from your colleagues.
* **Opt into accountability:** Use WIP and quarterly check-ins to share and reflect on your work. Be proactive about addressing changing plans and slipping deadlines.
* **Assume best intentions on the team:** Commit to dialogue and bring concerns to the group whenever possible.
* **Reflect on our processes:** Abide by “How We Work”, think critically and thoughtfully about how we can work together as individuals, as a team, and as a community.
* **If you have spare time, speak up:** We work hard, and we trust that our teammates are working hard too.
* **Grow with the organization:** Do your part to ensure that you and the organization are evolving together.
* **Make time for transition:** Document your work to serve P2PU in the long run, and be actively involved in the transition when you leave the organization. Do you best to leave with at least eight weeks notice.
