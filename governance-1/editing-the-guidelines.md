# ü§ù Decision Making

Governing by consensus does not mean that everything goes to a vote: each team member has authority over their respective domain of expertise. Additionally, any team member is afforded to right to propose changes to the governance model and organization policies. Small changes, such as editing a policy to accommodate an unforeseen circumstance, can be proposed directly to the Executive Committee on an ad hoc basis. Large changes, such as drafting new policies or proposing changes that contradict existing policy, should be included in the agenda for the next Board meeting for Board approval. Any proposed changes which contradict P2PU bylaws require changing the bylaws themselves.

### Arbitration

Additionally, team members have recourse through Board arbitration when consensus can‚Äôt be reached on a major decision. In those cases, this four-step arbitration process can be used:

1. **Document issue**: The team outlines the decision that needs to be made with the Board, supplying backup documentation in support of each perspective.
2. **Involve Board**: The Board nominates a subcommittee to participate in the process. 
3. **Develop Proposal**: Board committee meets with the team and remains available for individual feedback from team members. During a review period, any team members can reach out to the board facilitator to raise additional points or make further suggestions they did not want to make in the group. This input can be treated confidential.
4. **Reach Solution**:  The Board committee prepares a joint proposal with the team for board review and approval. The issue is either shared with the board by email or added to the agenda for the next board meeting. The board discusses the issue, considers the team solution, reviews additional input, may make further amendments, and makes a decision.

### Ending Staff Engagement

While the Executive Director is charged with ensuring that team member performance remains in line with the needs of the organization, any team member can bring concerns of this nature before the rest of the team, and the team should strive to implement performance improvement plans collectively. If unmet expectations escalate to a point that terminating employment becomes a plausible outcome, a call should be scheduled between 2-3 Board members, the ED, and the team member in question to discuss the issue and establish possible paths forward. In this case, performance review notes and quarterly updates will serve as the basis for discussion.
