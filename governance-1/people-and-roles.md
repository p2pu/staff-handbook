# üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è People and Roles

**Board of Directors**

The Board, comprised of 4-12 individuals, is responsible for the overall strategy and long-term sustainability of the organization. The Board is responsible for advising on and and making decisions that have broad implications or liabilities for P2PU, such as overall strategy, in-principal litigation, new program investment, new positions, or budget shortfalls. The Board has fiduciary duties to ensure that monies are spent in line with an agreed annual budget and the decisions taken at each board meeting. The bylaws of P2PU require an annual Board meeting, however P2PU currently strives to hold six virtual meetings per year.

The term of each board member is two years, and no board member may serve more than four consecutive terms. However, they may be re-elected to the Board after a one year absence. Additional stipulations of the Board, including nominations, removal and resignation, and the requirements of Board meetings can be found in P2PU‚Äôs bylaws and the amendments to the bylaws.
