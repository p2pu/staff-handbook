# ðŸ’° Salary Model

We believe that people should be fairly compensated for the work they do, and that our compensation model should reflect a holistic view of our team. As such, the salary model is was established collaboratively by the team, and approved by the Board. All salary information is shared across the team. Additionally, our model stipulates that nobody should earn more than twice as much as anybody else.

Outside of an annual review that happens alongside setting the budget, there are a few events that can trigger ad hoc adjustments to the salary model:

* If somebody moves, it is contingent on them to update their cost of living. Change to their salary is effective the first full month employee is in a new place.
* When an employee hits a biennial anniversary and is eligible for a service round increase, itâ€™s their responsibility to make it an agenda item at the following Board meeting for discussion and approval by the Board.
