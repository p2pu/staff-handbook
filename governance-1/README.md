# Governance

Central to the P2PU ethos is a unique governance model inspired by the principles of shared and open source governance. At its heart, this model is a commitment to walking the walk and ensuring that as a team, we are living by the values of open, equity, peer learning, and community that we advocate for in our work.&#x20;

The governance processes are not a static set of rules, and are expected to evolve over time within the constraints set forth by the P2PU bylaws. Governance is executed through a consensus-based decision making process, facilitated by the Executive Director. Joining P2PU as a team member affords you the following rights and responsibilities:

* Open salary model and shared finances
* Annual goal setting and quarterly check-ins
* Team-wide attendance at P2PU Board meetings
* Peer-formance review and staffing decisions
* Ad hoc meetings to review major decisions
* Ability to advocate for changes to the governance process
