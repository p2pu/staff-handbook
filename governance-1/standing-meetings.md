# ðŸ’¬ Standing Meetings

### Board Meetings

Twice annual convening of the Board. First meeting tends to focus more on implementing strategy, second meeting on approving the next yearâ€™s budget. 

### Board Strategy Meetings

Informal Board chats designed to get feedback from the Board on specific issues that arise, generally 2-4x per year.

### Quarterly Strategy Updates

During a weekly team call near the end of each quarter, the team will meet to discuss individual and collective progress against organizational goals. The purpose of this call is to serve as a bridge between Work in Progress and annual review, and progress will be judged against both WIP progress and community health/revenue metrics as agreed on by the team. During the third and fourth quarter calls, this space will also be used to look forward and establish organizational goals for the following year.

### Working Culture Review

Early each year, the team will convene to chart and reflect on our growth as individuals and a team. As a basis, we use Human User Guides for this discussion, a 6-part framework in which we each articulate our approaches to leadership, communication, feedback, conflict management, personality, and goals. The hope for this call is for each of us to better understand how we can support one another, improve organizational effectiveness, and create a better P2PU for all team members.

### Peer-Based Performance Review

The annual performance review process is peer-led and designed to be constructive in nature. It is a space for the team to come together to reflect on our respective work in the context of organizational goals and identify places where our expectations of one another \(and ourselves\) have not been met. After sharing written self-assessments, the team convenes to reflect on each otherâ€™s feedback, and raise any issues that havenâ€™t yet been surfaced. From here, the team identifies any next steps required \(e.g. professional development opportunities, future check-ins to address unresolved issues, performance improvement plans\).
