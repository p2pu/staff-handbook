# üï¥Ô∏èHiring Policy

P2PU engages individuals at various classifications of interest, responsibility, and expectation. We are constantly striving to be as open as possible to capture the enthusiasm and motivation of the widest, most diverse audience, while maintaining a strategic, mission-driven voice across all of our work.

**Team Members**

The team and Board will seek to identify the need for new hires during the annual strategy and budget discussions. If funds are available or can be reasonably identified and the Board approves, the team will draft a job description. The board must approve the job title, general responsibilities of the role, and salary range before the job description is made public. Once a job description goes out, the team is responsible for identifying candidates for interview and conducting first round interviews. P2PU publicly announces all positions, rather than hiring exclusively through existing networks, to obtain as wide a field of candidates as possible.

Once 3-4 candidates are selected by the team, the application packages and notes are passed on to the Board. Interview packages should include:

* Resume
* Cover letter
* Portfolio \(if applicable\)
* Proposed salary and justification \(mapped to open salary model\)
* Interview notes

The Board will then form a subcommittee of at least three Board members to interview the final candidates and review the open salary-model proposal assembled by the team. The Board will confer with team members and seek consensus, but ultimately it is the Board who has final say as to who to hire and and at what salary level.

#### Consultants & Interns <a id="hiring-non-team-memberscontractors"></a>

P2PU may contract consultants or hire interns to engage with P2PU for a specific amount of time towards a specific project or goal. In the case of consultants, there should be a clear case as to why the work should be done by somebody who is not a team members. In the case of interns, there should be a clear mutual interest for P2PU and an individual.

If funds and a job brief have been allocated for a contractor \(non-team member\) by the Board, then the team can proceed to hire whoever they see best fit without additional Board approval. In this case, the pay rate should be negotiated between the team and the contractor to ensure the task can be completed on time.

**Volunteers**

P2PU supports a robust community of volunteers, many of whom work with P2PU as part of their employment or studies as a different institution. Community members are invited to be as active in the organization as possible, but they do not receive remuneration for their work with P2PU. As an organization, P2PU strives to maximize the participation, opinion, and contributions of volunteers.
