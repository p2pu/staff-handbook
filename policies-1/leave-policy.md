# üèñÔ∏è Time Off Policy

P2PU believes that a well rested team executes better and we are aware of the many demands facing our staff outside of work. As such, we want to be as supportive and flexible as possible while remaining responsible to the organization and to our colleagues. With the exception of holiday closure, all leave is pro-rated for team members working less than full time. It is up to the team member taking the leave to be proactive about communicating the leave and ensuring coverage during their time away.

### Annual Leave

Each employee is entitled to 15 days of paid leave per year (accrued at a rate of 1.25 days/month) plus 10 public holidays, aligning with the jurisdiction of residence. In addition, P2PU is closed the week between Dec 25 and January 1 (inclusive) and staff are not required to work during that week.&#x20;

Leave days accrued in one calendar year cannot be carried over into the next calendar year. Employees should notify the team as early as possible of their leave plans and update the [leave register](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h31oT-FJ9Rv76HU4u1I303oPm1xp9erDcwy15BWQjSg/edit#gid=0) and shared calendar. If employees plan to take a leave of longer than one week, they should discuss this with the rest of the team at least one month ahead of time to ensure that operations can continue smoothly in their absence.&#x20;

### Sick Leave

P2PU offers paid time off for illness or injury (including illness or injury of spouse, domestic partner, children, or parents), and doctor and dental visits. Staff are eligible for 7 days of sick leave per year. We recognize that extenuating circumstances may extend beyond 7 days: in these cases, there should be a conversation and it may result in needing to take leave days and/or unpaid leave. Sick time does not accrue year over year, nor will employees be paid for any unused sick leave upon leaving P2PU. Within reason, employees should notify colleagues of a sick day before the start of their working hours.

### Family Leave

P2PU will always recognize and support their employees in taking the legally mandated parental leave required for employees in their local jurisdiction. This includes leave for both primary and alternate caregivers, for both biological and surrogate, step or other dependent children. In recognition of the fact that many jurisdictions provide no or minimal leave entitlement for caregivers other than the primary caregiver, P2PU has adopted the following minimum standard that will be applied to all employees where they exceed the legally mandated standards in their local jurisdiction.&#x20;

All new parents are entitled to up to 28 days paid leave to be taken within the first 18 months of birth or adoption of a new child. Birthing parents are entitled to an additional 28 days paid leave, to be taken in the window of time between two weeks prior to the estimated due date and up to eight weeks after birth.&#x20;

Given the size of P2PU, extended absence has a large impact on the team. Therefore, we ask to be informed as soon as a new parent feels comfortable doing so. To qualify for family leave, an employee must have completed 12 months of service at P2PU, otherwise the policy falls back to state mandated minimums. P2PU will also pay for a baby P2PU onesie (as well as a P2PU tattoo once the kid turns 18).

### Bereavement Leave

P2PU supports staff who suffer a personal loss that is likely to take a financial, psychological, and logistical toll on the team member. Team members who need to take some leave in response to the death of a close family member are entitled to one or more days of paid leave at that time to a maximum of 5 days per calendar year. As soon as possible, bereavement leave should be communicated with P2PU staff.

### Unpaid Leave

In certain circumstances, team members may wish to take extended, unpaid leave. All new parents are additionally entitled to take up to three months of unpaid leave within the first 18 months of birth or adoption. Additional unpaid leave should be addressed by the team on a case-by-case basis.\
